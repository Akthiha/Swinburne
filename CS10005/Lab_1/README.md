# Purpose

In this lab, we are going to:

- Create a simple HTML page.
- Learn about some browser features used in web development.

# Task

### Step 1: Create a web page for testing.

Select the 'files' icon in the top left corner of the IDE and then '+'. Name the file `index.html`. Alternatively, there is a placeholder file already there. You can right-click the file and select 'Rename' to convert the file to your HTML file or delete the file if you have created a new HTML file.

### Step 2: Encode the following into your new HTML file (just copy and paste the code):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>My First HTML 5 webpage</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="description" content="Web development">
    <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript">
    <meta name="author" content="your name">
</head>
<body>
    <!-- First HTML5 Example -->
    <h1>Web Development Lab01</h1>
    <h2>THIS IS MY FIRST WEB PAGE!</h2>
    <h2>I DID IT!</h2>
    <h2>I DID IT!</h2>
    <p>Wait. Can I use .htm instead of .html as my file extension?</p>
    <p><em>Give it a shot!</em></p>
</body>
</html>
